## Concept
Demonstrate the use on node.js, express and other technologies to implement text and video chat, implement groups etc. The app is currently deployed at [https://dry-falls-52563.herokuapp.com]. You are welcome to create your own account or use guest/trilogy

## Packages/technologies Used
- node
- express
- express-handlebars
- express-sessions
- bcrypt
- socket.io
- webrtc

## Installation
- Clone the github repo
- Run 'npm install' to install all the packages
- Run 'npm start' 

## Limitations
This project is a work in progress.
Eventual goal is to have X number of people in a room. However, right now only 2 video feeds will work in the same room. This can be easily fixed by appending all new feeds to the remote-videos div. Multiple users can certainly join and chat in the room.
